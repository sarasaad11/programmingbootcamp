# programmingbootcamp
Al-Imam mohammed ibn saud university created a bootcamp for programming 

so We solved this problem which is 

Our good friend Mole is trying to code a big message. He is typing on an unusual keyboard with characters arranged in following way:


qwertyuiop
asdfghjkl;
zxcvbnm,./
Unfortunately Mole is blind, so sometimes it is problem for him to put his hands accurately. He accidentally moved both his hands with one position to the left or to the right. That means that now he presses not a button he wants, but one neighboring button (left or right, as specified in input).

We have a sequence of characters he has typed and we want to find the original message.
